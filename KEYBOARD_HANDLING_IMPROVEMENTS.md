# Keyboard Handling Improvements

## Problem

The screen was not adjusting properly when the keyboard appeared, causing input fields to be covered by the keyboard and making it difficult for users to see what they were typing.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. App Configuration (app.json)

Added `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode: "pan"` to the Android configuration to enable proper keyboard handling on Android devices.

```json
"android": {
  "adaptiveIcon": {
    "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
  },
  "softwareKeyboardLayoutMode": "pan"
}
```

### 2. Installed react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view

This package provides better keyboard handling than the built-in KeyboardAvoidingView for complex forms.

```bash
npm install react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view
```

### 3. Updated Screen Components

#### AuthScreen.jsx

- Enhanced existing KeyboardAvoidingView with proper offset
- Added `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` to ScrollView

#### EditProfileScreen.jsx

- Replaced KeyboardAvoidingView with KeyboardAwareScrollView
- Added proper keyboard handling for multiple input fields
- Configured for both iOS and Android platforms

#### EditPasswordScreen.jsx

- Replaced KeyboardAvoidingView with KeyboardAwareScrollView
- Enhanced password input fields with proper keyboard handling

#### ManageServicesScreen.jsx

- Added KeyboardAvoidingView to the modal for service creation/editing
- Ensures form inputs are accessible when keyboard is open

### 4. Key Features Added

#### KeyboardAwareScrollView Configuration

```jsx
<KeyboardAwareScrollView
  contentContainerStyle={styles.formContainer}
  showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
  keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"
  enableOnAndroid={true}
  enableAutomaticScroll={Platform.OS === "ios"}
  extraHeight={150}
  extraScrollHeight={150}
>
```

#### Benefits:

- **enableOnAndroid**: Ensures keyboard handling works on Android
- **enableAutomaticScroll**: Automatic scrolling on iOS
- **extraHeight/extraScrollHeight**: Additional space to ensure inputs are fully visible
- **keyboardShouldPersistTaps**: Allows tapping on inputs without dismissing keyboard

### 5. Platform-Specific Handling

- iOS: Uses automatic scroll with padding behavior
- Android: Uses pan mode with manual scroll handling
- Cross-platform compatibility ensured

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on both iOS and Android devices**
2. **Test with different keyboard types** (default, email, numeric)
3. **Test multiline inputs** (address, description fields)
4. **Test form submission** while keyboard is open
5. **Test scrolling** through long forms

## Files Modified

1. `app.json` - Added Android keyboard configuration
2. `screens/AuthScreen.jsx` - Enhanced existing keyboard handling
3. `screens/EditProfileScreen.jsx` - Replaced with KeyboardAwareScrollView
4. `screens/EditPasswordScreen.jsx` - Replaced with KeyboardAwareScrollView
5. `screens/ManageServicesScreen.jsx` - Added KeyboardAvoidingView to modal

## Additional Notes

- The KeyboardAwareScrollView is more reliable than KeyboardAvoidingView for complex forms
- All forms now properly adjust when keyboard appears
- Users can scroll through forms while keyboard is open
- Input fields remain visible and accessible
- Keyboard dismisses appropriately when tapping outside inputs
